This was just a short little project to visualize some Minecraft data (How resistant each block is to explosions, by class). I was basically pivoting data that needed to be concatenated rather than summed or counted.  I also counted it, compiled all of this in a .csv and then used Tableau online to visualize it.  That workbook view is embeded in embed.html, and the workbook can be downloaded directly.

I used Python to write the script to gain exposure to the language.  While I've used Python scripts before, this was the first one I've written from scratch.  Nothing too fancy, just a little exercise in a new language.

The end result is basically just "all.png" but since not everything fit in that image, "zoom.png" is also included.
